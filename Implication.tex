\section{Implications}

There is a rich literature on children's pronoun case errors, but some issues are unsettled because of methodological limitations. With a comprehensive corpus analysis, this study can settle questions, such as when and how often do pronoun case errors occur in children's speech and how prevalent such errors are. In addition, this study will evaluate how well existing theories handle the same set of corpus. That could provide insights about the pros and cons of usage-based, input-based and generative-linguistics-based hypotheses about acquisition. Besides finding the best explanations for pronoun case errors, this study also attempts to answer how do children acquire pronoun case by comparing linguistically-based hypotheses and statistical learning approaches.
